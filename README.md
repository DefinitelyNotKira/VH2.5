# VH2.5
For Config/Script Changes to the VH2 Modpack

Do you miss Vault Hunters 2nd Edition? Did you maybe never finish the modpack? Or maybe this is your first time?
Vault Hunters 2.5 is here to offer a retrospective on the modpack after experiencing Vault Hunters 3rd Edition.

The goal is to craft our own special version of VH2 using config changes, script changes, and datapacks. For many of us, we have already played an extensive amount of VH2, so this be a way of keeping it fresh. Some changes may also speed up progression, so it's more viable for someone to come in and finish the Final Vault!
